### Key Components

-   **HomeScreen.js**: Implements the homepage with a ranking list, search bar, and filter functionality.
-   **InstitutionDetails.js**: Displays detailed information about selected institutions.
-   **ChartScreen.js**: Provides dynamic bar charts for research area publication data.
-   **AboutScreen.js**: Includes information about CSRankings, useful links, and acknowledgments.

### Data Handling

-   Static JSON files (`universities.json`, `rank.json`, `subarea.json`, `faculty.json`) were created and used to simulate backend data.
-   Data was dynamically linked and parsed to maintain accurate relationships between institutions and their faculty/publications.
